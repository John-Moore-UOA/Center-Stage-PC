#  Centre Stage for PC
This is a quick attempt to make a centre stage clone with python.  
This can be connected to discord through a virtual webcamera

## Preview
The web camera was in the same position when I took these snap shots.
There is also a smoothing effect to reduce noise / shaking.

## Eye detection
I am not sure where I want to take this.
Perhaps this could morph into another project where I triangleulate the direction the face is pointing, and therefore move the mouse cursor.  
Then purhaps you could smile to click.
